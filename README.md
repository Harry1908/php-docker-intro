## What is this repo for?
This is a simple php docker-compose setup with nginx.
With this setup we will build a small website.
The goal of this project is not to build the fanciest website, but to apply our new learnt topics php and sass.

### Exercise 1
Clone this git repository and write your first php code.
(hint: use the echo function)

### Exercise 2
Build a simple website with 3 pages:
- Home
- About me
- Portrait of your favorite dish

Add a header and footer to your website by using the php function "include". This means you don't have to write the footer and the navigation three times, but can *include* it in your pages.
Don't add any styling yet.

### Exercise 3
Last week we learnt SASS. Therefore we will build this website using SASS.
